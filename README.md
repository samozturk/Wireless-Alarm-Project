# Smart Bicycle Project
My own design of wireless alarm project for my bicycle with arduino.

1st Commit:

First box consists of vibration sensor, buzzer circuit and arduino nano.
Vibration sensor connected to pin 2.
Buzzer(Cheap door alarm) connected to 5V relay and relay connected to pin 3.

2nd Commit:

Added nrf24l01 wireless module to send me a message if sensor detects a vibration.
nrf24l01 datasheet: https://components101.com/wireless/nrf24l01-pinout-features-datasheet


I decided to use cheap speedometer instead of doing it.
